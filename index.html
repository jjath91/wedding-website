            <p class="max-w-xl mx-auto mb-6">Who knew a casual ski trip in Breckenridge in April 2021 would change everything?This is where our story begins.  Jami, living in Denver, met JJ, who was visiting from Atlanta with a mutual friend. An invitation to a cozy cabin sparked an immediate connection. They felt instantly comfortable and quickly became inseparable, talking every day after that initial weekend. With JJ's move to San Francisco on the horizon, they embraced long distance with open arms and a sense of fun. <br /><br />Their relationship became a tapestry of adventures: romantic trips to Napa, exhilarating ski trips to various mountains, and incredible journeys across Europe! â€“ Their motto became, "If we're going to fly, let's make it an adventure!" After a year of building their life together in Georgia, the vibrant energy of New York City called them to their next adventure. From a chance meeting on a ski trip, they've created a life filled with love and laughter, shared with their three dogs, Starsky, Hutch, and Boone. </p>
